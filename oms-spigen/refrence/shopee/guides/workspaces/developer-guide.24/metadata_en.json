What is the difference between the Shopee-Certified Enablers Program and Service Partner Program?\n\nThe Service Partner Program offered on Open Platform is strictly for ISVs who have access to Shopee Open Platform. Although some enablers also have access to Open Platform, this program focuses on security and commercial performance, instead of operational and engagement performance.\n\n---\n\n## Scoring\n\n### 1. How is \"active seller\" defined?\n\nAn active seller must have made a successful functional API call via your APP in the last 90 days. The seller must also have had at least 1 order in the last 90 days.\n\n### 2. What counts as a successful acquisition of a seller?\n\nAcquisition of a seller is only counted if:\n- (a) the ISV was the active party in bringing the seller onto the Shopee platform, i.e. seller must not have been selling on Shopee platform and then started using services provided by you afterwards, and\n- (b) the seller is an active seller as defined above in Scoring FAQ 1\n\n### 3. How often am I required to submit a valid Security Document to Shopee?\n\nPenetration Test Reports: You are required to submit a valid penetration test report once every year. If there are significant changes to your IT assets, a new penetration test report should be submitted to reflect those changes.\n\nSecurity Certifications: These only need to be submitted once during their validity period. You must resubmit the certification once it expires or is renewed.\n\n### 4. How does Shopee know if we have vulnerabilities in our system?\n\nShopee performs regular vulnerability screening on the IT assets that you declare on your Open Platform Console. If you do not declare your IT assets, Shopee cannot assess your IT security, and you will be considered to have not met the Application Security requirements. Shopee strongly recommends that you declare and update your IT assets regularly, to meet the Application Security requirements and secure marketing benefits for your business.\n\n### 5. What is considered an unrectified vulnerability?\n\nA vulnerability is only considered unrectified if you do not complete the recommended rectification from Shopee by the allocated time in the quarter. To avoid this, please regularly visit the Open Platform Vulnerability Dashboard, and perform the recommended actions ASAP.\n\n### 6. Can you provide some examples of a valid Security Document?\n\nYou may refer to the file here for a list of acceptable Security Document that Shopee accepts. You can redact detailed portions of the security documents if you believe that they are sensitive information, but it should still show the vulnerability, rating and remediation status of your IT infrastructure.\n\n**No open critical or high vulnerabilities should also exist in your report.**\n\n---\n\n## Benefits and Penalties\n\n### 1. Other than exposure on Shopee's seller platforms, how do I find out more about market-specific marketing benefits?\n\nYou can find out about market-specific marketing benefits by reaching out to your Relationship Managers (RMs). You may also raise a ticket via our Shopee Ticket System.\n\n### 2. If I meet the criteria in the middle of a quarter, will I immediately become a Premium Service Partner?\n\nNo, you will only become a Premium Service Partner in the next quarter as your performance is calculated on a quarterly basis.\n\n### 3. What is the period of assessment for each screening?\n\nThe screening will be based on your performance from the first to last day of each quarter.\n\nFor example, a screening for 2022 Q2 will assess the ISV's performance from 1 April 2022 to 30 June 2022.\n\n---\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n### 1. Who should I contact for more information about the rewards?\n\nYou may reach out to your Relationship Manager (RM) or your local Product Support team if you have any questions. You will be able to find this detail in the email sent to you if you are eligible for the program. You may also raise a ticket via our Shopee Ticket System.\n\n### 2. Why am I not onboarded as a Premium Service Partner, or excluded from receiving benefits even though I have met the criteria for both the commercial and security performance categories?\n\nPlease note that we reserve the right to exclude certain ISVs from our Service Partner Program if they are found to be violating our Platform Partner Rules. Other reasons could include legal issues that prohibit us from granting you certain benefits.\n\n### 3. How will I know if I am subsequently offboarded from the program in the next quarter?\n\nIf you do not receive an email confirmation by the 2nd Monday of the 1st month in the quarter, you can assume that you are no longer a Premium Service Partner. You will not be receiving any of the rewards as well.\n\n### 4. When will we receive the rewards and for how long?\n\nEach reward cycle lasts from the date of announcement until the 2nd Monday of the new quarter.",
