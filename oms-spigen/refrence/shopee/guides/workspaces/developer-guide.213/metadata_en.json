  "extracted_text": "# API Best Practices - Creating global product\n\n## Overview\n\nAfter the shop product is created, the shop product needs to be mapped to a global product to display its name and description in a unified product in Chinese or English, and set up to synchronize the update to the shop products. Shopper will automatically translate into the local language.\n\n- Support asynchronous update real-time updates for shop products. For some real-time synchronized product information, sellers can watch the asynchronous background task execution status to see shop product information.\n- The product information synchronization sellers can configure the synchronization rules. For example, the priority of product information updates. for example, the global product with the highest priority according to the results of the formula calculation.\n\n**Note:** When shop products integrate with Global API and shop products integrate to Merchant API such as `Global Product API`, shoppers you need to manage product information with global products. For other APIs such as order API, the changes are needed.\n\n- Use `CMSC API` to learn more about CMS.\n- Click `here` to learn more about IMSC.\n\n### The CMSC/IMSC account system\n\nWhen a seller account is created in CMSC or IMSC through this integration, Only applicable to cross-border sellers.\n\n---\n\n## Terminology Description\n\n- **Main account**: The basic account with highest authority, the account owner is usually a corporate entity, and has permission to create and add all sub-accounts of the seller. The login format of the main account is ACC_main.\n- **Shop**: The pages users find through shop's account. Shops to multiple markets use sub Merchant. A CMSC main account may have multiple shops affiliated.\n- **Item**: When you upgrade the shops to CMSC/IMSC accounts, You will get the basic account for authorization, and only the main account is permitted to make API calls. (Both the main account and sub-accounts support API calls if the seller chooses own account, then use for multiple Merchants, andunder each Merchant, there can be multiple market including SPS shop Merchant, there may be multiple shops of the same market under Merchant.\n\n---\n\n## Global products and shop products\n\nIn the following, we will explain the relationship with product and shop product.\n\n```\nMerchant 1\n\nSHIPBU - MTPSH 11\n\n└── US\n└── MX\n└── BR\n\n└── MTPSH 2\n    └── MTPSH 3\n    └── MTPSH 4\n```\n\n| Abbreviation | CMSC/IMSC | Description |\n|--------------|-----------|-------------|\n| MTPSH | Global SKU | Sellers will manage some basic product information by MTPSH, including product name, product description, images, etc. After publishing to differentiate, markets, shop SKU will be created, and seller can manage market-specific information for the changes to shop products |\n| MPSKU | Shop SKU | Real shop products from shop |\n\n---\n\n## Changes in product management process\n\nAfter the adoption of the global product management process, there are changes to the product management process.\n\n### 1. Product creation\n\nNew product created process through **an online product sale device API**, and then call `product/createProduct` with an API to publish and synchronize shop products with shop products from more product category. For more details about the publishing process use: [link]\n\n### 2. Field management\n\nWe divide the product-related fields into three categories:\n\n1. **Fields can only be managed by MTPSH**: These fields can't be created differences, such as categories, attributes, etc. Fields can be managed by MTPSH can be updated by both. All global fields can update to all shop products, but if MTPSH is a seller's public managed fields. These fields have (select) differentiatable, such as product names and product descriptions. If fields choose to require the field select through the MTPSH, the account will transfer to the shop products automatically. If you don't select it, account configure synchronization rules, the priority will update according to the global product.\n\n2. **Fields can only be managed by MPSKU**: These fields can only be managed through the global product, like logistics info.\n\n| API Field | Manage by MTPSH | Manage by MPSKU |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|\n| category_id | ✓ | ✗ |\n| attribute | ✓ | ✗ |\n| brand | ✓ | ✓ |\n| item_name | ✓ | ✓ |\n| description | ✓ | ✓ |\n| weight | ✓ | ✗ |\n| dimension | ✓ | ✗ |\n| price | ✗ | ✓ |\n| stock | ✗ | ✓ |\n| image/video | ✓ | ✓ |\n| days_to_ship | ✓ | ✓ |\n| item_status | ✓ | ✓ |\n| condition | ✓ | ✓ |\n| item sku | ✗ | ✓ |\n| size_variation structure | ✓ | ✗ |\n| size_variation name/caption | ✓ | ✓ |\n| logistics | ✗ | ✓ |\n\n---\n\n### Please note that:\n\n- When you upgrade the shops to CMSC/IMSC, the limit of MTPSH is 5k and MTPSH daily published MPSKU is 2en MPSKU. From the limit of MTPSH is MTPSH is 1K. When the base published size MTPSH is 2en K, the stock of MTPSH is 2en The available of difference.\n\n- Different countries have the stock - all shop products for which the global post has been published are different. However, shop products can be deleted and unifre individually without affecting global products.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Calling categories\n\n### Product listing\n\n**Creating global product:** If you first connect to Shopper cross-border management, it is recommended to issue through either **Product standard information API**, or **Global product sale API**. More information can be found: [link]\n\n#### 3.1 Calling categories\n\nUse `/api/v1/global_product/category` \n\n**Please note that:**\n- For different categories, the API returns the same category tree data\n- Even if different categories return the same response structure, the category attribute and information (category A) is not available in Malaysia shop, but available in Brazil shop, we will prompt you not to publish the category, but can update the global products. For more details about categories information, see API call for the locally available.\n\n#### 3.2 Calling recommended categories\n\n```\n/api/v1/global_product/get_recommend_category\n```\n\n---\n\n# Developer Guide - Getting Categories and Product Information\n\n## 3.1 Getting categories\n\nAPI: `tv.taobao.products.get_category`\n\nPlease note that:\n- Sellers are not allowed to select the same category too often.\n- `tv.taobao.products.get_category` API will return the available category for global product, but there may be a situation that authorized API is not enough to create the product successfully, in which case you need to confirm with the Aliexpress PD for the latest available category. You can also publish products through Seller Center to know the available category for each market, you can call `tv.product.get_category` API.\n\n## 3.2 Getting attribute\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.category_properlised`\n\n## 3.3 Getting attribute value\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.get_attribute_traits`\n\nPlease note that:\nSome attributes such as attribute name, required, request/parameter and mandatory, region response, parameter, because for some attributes, such as flavor, different only products in the Taiwan market are compulsory, if the seller doesn't want to publish in Taiwan market, he can ignore it, don't need to check the process of global product creation, so the attribute will be visible in the attribute list, in case, please ignore them. The actual situation depends on whether the corresponding value is required. For these remain attributes:\n- Except for the special automatic features in the list point, all other attributes, as long as one of the markets request a value, are returned, the attribute_name should be filled, and the tv.product_product.get_attribute_traits API.\n\n## 3.4 Getting recommendation attribute\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.get_ai_attribute_traits`\n\n## 3.5 Getting the available brand list\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.get_brand_list`\n\n## 3.6 Getting days to ship\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.get_day_to_ship`\n\nPlease note that:\n`tv.global_product.get_day_to_ship` will return a concatenation of the number of shipping days that can be filled in all markets.\n\n```json\n\"data_is_ship_range_list\": [\n  {\n    \"country\": \"SG\",\n    \"ship\": \"15\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"country\": \"MY\",\n    \"ship\": \"15\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBatch case: For batch shipping days for global products are 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13.\nYou can also save the rich table of `tv.product.get_day_to_ship` to get more precise shipping days for each market.\n\n## 3.7 Getting information about categories\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.get_ai_attribute_traits`\n\nPlease note that:\nWe are setting out the latest white list which review the `announcement` for details.\n\n## 3.8 Getting global product restrictions\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.category_rules_get`\n\nPlease note that:\nAt present, `category_name_product_base` For All PGU product restrictions/prohibitions name and option name, we have included prohibited information, you can get. Since the Chinese and English translations are not exactly the same, information like the English translation, the market language, so in order to Chinese and English have different Chinese length limits, use translation, and other languages will be synchronized to the Chinese character. (Chinese character limit is 30, other languages will be synchronized to the Chinese character limit of 60)\n\n```json\n\"cnt_length_restriction\": 2.44,\n\"cnt_length_rules\": \"length\" = 240,\n\"eng_length_rules\": 2.5 * \n    cnt_length,\n\"local_limit\": 500\n```\n\nIn other words, if the seller fills in the product name in English, the maximum number of characters is 1 is 500. If the seller fills the product name in Chinese, the maximum number of characters is 1 is 250 (because 500/2 = 44 = 250.50 characters).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Creating global product\n\nThe configuration of global products shall meet certain requirements or rules before creating global products.\nSellers need to log in to CNSC/MNSC to complete the configuration of onboarding and exchange rate before creating global products, otherwise you will encounter errors like `unauthorized` and etc.\n\n- For the onboarding procedure, please refer to: https://shopee.ph/edu/article/1741\n- Set the currency : https://seller.shopee.ph/account/settings/address\n\n---\n\n## 4.2 Completing the main account authorization\n\nplease refer to `Authorization/UserAuthorization`\n\n## 4.3 Getting the merchant id list and shop id under the main account\n\nThe following APIs can be called:\n- To get a list of current authorized merchant id list and shop id through `tv.seller.get_authorized_shop` API after authorization.\n- Before calling the API to complete the authorization, call API to `tv.shop.get_shop_list` API to get the information of each authorized shop, including the relationship between id and primary shop and affiliated shops.\n- To get primary shop information, call `tv.shop.get_shop_info` API to get the `s1_main_shop` field is not returned.\n- If it is a SIP primary shop, `s1_gm1test.test.the_sip_info` Shop field is returned.\n- For the main account authorized multiple `s1_gm1test.test.the_sip_info` Shop field is not returned.\n\n---\n\n## 4.4 Product translation information synchronization\n\nTranslation support:\nSellers can get beforehand translation information was automatically synchronized to shop products through CNSC/MNSC or API.\n\nCNSC/MNSC Screenshot:\n\n**Merchant setting**\n\n[Table showing merchant settings with columns for setting type, various status fields, and descriptions]\n\n**Merchant setting** section shows options for:\n- Taobao Regional product information synchronization\n- Settings showing:\n  - Option for sync\n  - Synchronized ✓\n  - Not synchronize ✓\n  - Categories (with EN/CN indicators)\n  - Colors (Red, Blue, White)\n  \n*You should ensure sync_ authorized means no sync.*\n\nKey field is `tv.global_product.pre_trans_sync.txt`, *true* means sync, *false* means no sync.\n\n---\n\n## 4.5 Uploading image\n\n## 4.5.1 Uploading media files\n\nBefore calling any API to create or edit pre-saved in Shopee's media space, you need to call media_upload related API to upload files. For more details, please refer to the `show` \"Uploading media files\" section.\n\nIf you want to use product images or attribute images in CNSC/MNSC media space, you can call `tv.global_product.get_image_list` API to get the list of main images under the specified category.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Uploading category\n\nWe supports sellers to upload by categories so that they only select the category that returns `has_children=false from tv.global_product.get_category` API.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Translation requirements\n\nIn order to provide the best possible service to overseas Aliexpress merchants, we will have strict rules against the various products types (images, text, product description, etc.) to ensure the business is operated properly. Sellers are able to fill in simplified Chinese, English and numbers. Please do not mix simplified Chinese with traditional Chinese. If they meet local language words not being translated into local language. Note that the following requirements are mandatory.\n\nAbout translation:\nCross-border product descriptions can only be filled in simplified Chinese, English, and numbers.\n\nAbout restrictions:\nProhibited content: Regarding profanity and sensitive words can only be filled in simplified Chinese, English, and numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 4.6 Uploading global product information\n\nWhen uploading global product information, please note:\nWe currently support unfinished sellers to select the shop to description, please refer to the `FAQ` for details on how to add or upload images in the description part.\n\nAbout image uploading:\nCross-border Seller Center sellers can now make all of UPC for pricing. Accept cross-border sellers can use USD for pricing, and you can modify the pricing of `tv.global_product.product_add` API item without the price of the product.\n\nAbout price:\nFor Single Type product, the price will not be converted with the exchange rate directly.\n\n---\n\n## 4.6.1 Uploading global product stock\n\nAPI: `tv.global_product.product_add`\n\n---\n\n# 4.4.3 Uploading global product descriptions\n\n**Great product descriptions attract buyers on simplified Chinese, English, and numbers.**\n\n## Important Note\nWe currently support embedded videos to insert the image to description, please refer to the [FAQ for details](#) on how to insert the videos.\n\n---\n\n## 4.4.3 Uploading global product price\n\nOversea cross-border sellers can use RMB or USD for pricing. Oversea cross-border sellers can use USD for pricing, and domestic cross-border sellers can use RMB for pricing. For the [YJ conversion rate rules/common rate](#) API, there are other price units of the corresponding currency according to the currency selected by the sellers.\n\n---\n\n## 4.4.1 Uploading global product stock\n\nThe uploaded stock will go through a risk control review. If the review does not pass, a certain percentage of the uploaded stock will be frozen.\n\nFor example: If MT3501 publishes 3 MPU(s), then as MPU(s8, MPU(s8, MPU(s8), then when MT3501 stock is set to 100, stock MPU(s1+MPU(s2+MPU(s3)=120, then [MPU(s1, MPU(s2, and MPU(s3 will be displayed as stock 40 correspondingly.\n\n---\n\n## 4.8 Creating variants\n\nWhen you create a global product successfully, to upload_product_sku_wms_type API will return the global_item_id, which is the product identifier for the global products. If you also need to define multiple variants, you can use the [$z.global_product_sku_create_or_update API](#) to upload variants. Variable variants will be generated during bulk variants upload.\n\n> **Important:** Do not include variant specifications such as color and size in your product title and description.\n\n---\n\n## 4.8.1 Creating 1 tier variants\n\nAssuming that the product has a color specification, the color includes S, L, and XL. We can fill in the 1-tier variants position accordingly.\n\n### Example Table:\n\n| tier_index | size | price | stock | sku |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|-----|\n| tier_index[0] | S/3 | 100 | 10 | sku1 |\n| tier_index[1] | S | 200 | 20 | sku2 |\n| tier_index[2] | M | 300 | 10 | - |\n\n---\n\n## API Request Example:\n\n**Endpoint:** `sz.global_product_tier_tier_variation API request example:`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"global_item_id\": 1000170002,\n  \n  \"tier_variation\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"size\",\n      \n      \"option_list\": [\n        {\n          \"option\": \"S\",\n          \n          \"image\": {\n            \"image_id\": \"030ce4fd59c82e09a6bc78c8c3e7f\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"option\": \"L\",\n          \n          \"image\": {\n            \"image_id\": \"19bce4fd59c82e09a6bcf78c8c7f\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"option\": \"M\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \n  \"model_list\": [\n    {\n      \"tier_index\": [0],\n      \n      \"original_price\": 100,\n      \n      \"global_model_sku\": \"sku1\",\n      \n      \"model_stock\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"tier_index\": [1],\n      \n      \"original_price\": 200,\n      \n      \"global_model_sku\": \"sku2\",\n      \n      \"model_stock\": 20\n    },\n    {\n      \"tier_index\": [2],\n      \n      \"original_price\": 300,\n      \n      \"global_model_sku\": \"\",\n      \n      \"model_stock\": 30\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4.8.2 Creating 2-tier variants\n\nAssuming that the product has color and size specifications, the color includes red and blue, and the size cookies xl, s, and l.\n\n### Example Table:\n\n| tier_index | color | size | price | stock | sku |\n|------------|-------|------|-------|-------|-----|\n| tier_index[0][0] | Red | S | 100 | 10 | sku1 |\n| tier_index[0][1] | Red | L | 200 | 20 | sku2 |\n| tier_index[1][0] | Blue | XL | 500 | 30 | sku3 |\n| tier_index[1][1] | Blue | L | 400 | 40 | sku4 |\n\n---\n\n## API Request Example:\n\n**Endpoint:** `sz.global_product_tier_tier_variation API request example:`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"global_item_id\": 1000170002,\n  \n  \"tier_variation\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Color\",\n      \n      \"option_list\": [\n        {\n          \"option\": \"Red\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"option\": \"Blue\",\n          \n          \"image\": {\n            \"image_id\": \"030ce4fd59c82e09a6bc78c8c3e7f\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Size\",\n      \n      \"option_list\": [\n        {\n          \"option\": \"S\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"option\": \"XL\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Developer Guide - Product Variant Configuration\n\n## JSON Structure\n\n```json\n]\n},\n{\n  \"name\": \"size\",\n  \n  \"option_list\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"XL\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"L\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n],\n\n\"model\": [\n  {\n    \"tier_index\": [0,0],\n    \n    \"original_price\": 100,\n    \n    \"normal_stock\": 10,\n    \n    \"global_model_sku\": \"sku1\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"tier_index\": [0,1],\n    \n    \"original_price\": 200,\n    \n    \"normal_stock\": 20,\n    \n    \"global_model_sku\": \"sku2\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"tier_index\": [1,0],\n    \n    \"original_price\": 300,\n    \n    \"normal_stock\": 30,\n    \n    \"global_model_sku\": \"sku3\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"tier_index\": [1,1],\n    \n    \"original_price\": 400,\n    \n    \"normal_stock\": 40,\n    \n    \"global_model_sku\": \"sku4\"\n  } ]\n}\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n**Please note that:**\n\n- **The options you define will be displayed on the Shopee mall side in order. Shopee currently only supports the definition of up to 2-tier variation.**\n\n- **You can define an image for each variant. If it is a 2-tier variation product, you can only define the first layer of options that is, in the example, you can define variant images based on color, but not based on size. Once you want to add variant images, all the options in the first layer need to define the image. The image needs to be uploaded by calling the V2 media upload image API**\n\n- **The tier_index must start from 0 and not overflow, otherwise an error will be reported**\n\n- **It is recommended that you create variants after an interval of 5 seconds after creating an item, because there may be a delay in creating item data.**\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNext, please review **how to publish global product**",
