The possible statuses are:\n\n1. **Order Sent (logistics_pickup_done)**\n   - The URL and tracking number can be sent when updating the order status to Shipped.\n\n2. **Order Delivered (logistics_delivery_done)**\n   - The Delivered status will only be received if the order already has the Shipped status.\n   - OTP code verification: For Entrega Expressa channel, it is mandatory to have OTP code verification. Shopee will be generating the OTP code after seller arranges shipment. When seller is delivering the parcel to buyer, it is mandatory for seller to retrieve OTP code from buyer, and send it in API request when attempting to update tracking_status to logistics_delivery_done.\n\n3. **Delivery Failure (logistics_delivery_failed)**\n   - The Delivery Failure status will only be received if the order already has the Shipped status.\n   - Failed reason: For Entrega Expressa channel, it is mandatory for seller to send failed_reason when updating tracking_status to logistics_delivery_failed.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: after sending the Order Delivered or Delivery Failed statuses, no further status updates will be allowed, as both are finalizing statuses;\n\n*the tracking_number and tracking_url parameters should only be sent when updating the status to logistics_pickup_done*.\n\nHere is a link to the API documentation **/api/v2/logistics/update_tracking_status**.\n\n---\n\n## Channel Order Flow and Status\n\n### REQUESTED FLOW\n\n```\nUNPAID\n  ↓ 1\nREADY_TO_SHIP\n  ↓ 2\nPROCESSED\n  ↓ 3\nSHIPPED\n  ↓ 4\nTO_CONFIRM_RECEIVE\n  ↓ 5\nCOMPLETED\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **(1) Buyer paid the order and seller upload the invoice**\n\n2. **(2) Seller Arrange Shipment (ship_order API)**\n\n3. **(3) Seller updates order status as PICK_UP_DONE via (update_tracking_status API)**\n\n4. **(4) Seller updates order status as DELIVERY_DONE via (update_tracking_status API)**\n\n5. **(5) Buyer confirms receive the package**",
