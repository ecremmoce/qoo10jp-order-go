If you publish global products without uploading shop channels, we will choose the enabled and available shop channels for you by default.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Publishing global product\n\n**API:** `v2.global_product.create_publish_task`\n\nFor the optional fields of `v2.global_product.create_publish_task`, if you do not upload, Shopee will do some processing and upload to shop products. If you upload, it will be a custom value and Shopee will not do any processing. The specific logic is as follows:\n\n| Field Name | Upload the custom value |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| item_name | YES: Seller need to translate into local language then upload<br>NO: Shopee will help translate into the local language |\n| description_info/description | YES: Seller need to translate into local language then upload<br>NO: Shopee will help translate into the local language |\n| original_price | YES: Seller need to upload the price in local currency<br>NO: Shopee calculates local prices based on the price of global products and calculation formulas. |\n| tier_variation--name | YES: Seller need to translate into local language then upload<br>NO: Shopee will help translate into the local language |\n| tier_variation--option_list--option | YES: Seller need to translate into local language then upload<br>NO: Shopee will help translate into the local language |\n| image | YES: Seller uploads the custom images<br>NO: Shopee will copy the images of global products |\n\nAfter a successful API call, you will get a publish_task_id.\n\n**API:** `v2.global_product.get_publish_task_result`\n\nThis API will return whether the publish task was successful or not. If it succeeds, it will return the item_id, shop_id, and region information, if it fails, it will return the specific reason for the failure.\n\nPlease note: If the published shop is the SIP primary shop, then after the successful publication, Shopee will automatically publish the global product to the affiliated shops under the SIP primary shop.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Getting the list of published shop products\n\n**API:** `v2.global_product.get_published_list`\n\nAPI will return the item_id and shop_id of all the shops that have been successfully published for this global product, including the shop products that Shopee automatically publishes to the affiliated shops.\n\nPlease note: This API does not return shop products that have been published but have not done the shop authorization.",
