In addition, we also support most images in product description. And the product image files need to meet the following requirements:\n\n- Image size: <=5M\n- Image format: JPG, JPEG, PNG\n\n**Please note:**\n\n- **/2.https://seller.aliexpress.com/** API we only support image file upload, not support URLs. When the image is uploaded successfully, we will get an image token (fileUrl), you should save it together with a unique image_id. We recommend that the image_id be a combination of business semantics + timestamp + random number, such as main1_20191015121212_123.\n- After uploading successfully, we will check the image asynchronously (generally within 10 seconds, mostly just a few seconds).\n- If you upload a product image, the request parameter sums should be normal; if you upload a product description image, the image type should be description_image. When you create the product image we will transfer to a square main picture.\n\n---\n\n## 1.1 Uploading video\n\n**Provided video is optional. We support video files with the following requirements:**\n\n- Video size: <=500M\n- Video format: mp4\n- Video resolution/suggested: your width and height no more than 1280px * 720px\n- Upload time approximately costs about: 1GB takes 10 seconds. 1 Minute video approximately is about 9 to split it into 32, 64 of 100 segments, because each fragment cannot be larger than 4M.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n- Step 1: Call the **/upload_aeop_vod/**video_order** API. Create a video upload task and get the video_upload_id. You should save this value, because we need to check the video status through it.\n- Step 2: Call the **/upload_video_stream/**video_part** API. When the video file has fragments, the part_seq (should be from 0) parameter indicates the fragment number. Each time you can not upload file sizes larger than 4M of each fragment. It would be better if the part_seq continuous call could not be repeated (the same time, and must not be concurrent upload).\n- Step 3: After all fragments have been uploaded successfully, you must call the **/upload/**video**status** API to confirm completion of all video fragments files you uploaded. The part_seq is a parameter that the sequence number of all fragments. If each upload fragment part_seq from 0, which should be uploaded as 0,1,2, and then confirmed the value should be 0,1,2.\n- Step 4: Call the **/upload/**video/**order/**video** API. Get the video transcoding result, status value represents the result.\n\n**Transcoding video will generally take some time (within two minutes), during the period will be called **/upload/**video/** order**video** API to query video status. According to the current upload file of this interface returning, when the URLs and video cover image URL are still in processing, they will wait until it is done. Wait and at that time, the video_upload_id can be used to create or update the products.\n\nAfter uploading images and videos, you can call **/product/**add_order** API to create products. the following will explain the detail to create and update products by calling **/product/**add_order** API.\n\n---\n\n## 2 Uploading category and attributes\n\n### 2.1 Uploading category\n\nUploading products you can only select the leaf category ID. In this category box for the product, otherwise, the product can't create successfully, returning an error.\n\n### 2.2 Uploading attributes\n\nAPI: **/product/**get/**attribute/**result_order** API\n\nIn this category for the product, the product can select multiple attributes. Different categories attributes and attribute metadatas are considered required. You can refer to the article \"Product creation information\" to learn more about attributes and attribute types when calling **/product/**order**product** API by reference to the attributes list returned by the **/product/**get/**attribute/**result_order** API.\n\nWhen uploading the attribute with \"Input_type\": (\"INPUT_DROP_DOWN\"), you can only upload one \"value_id\" and fetch \"value_id\" must be one of the values from the attribute list returned by the **/product/**get/**attribute/**result_order** API.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```json\n\"attributes\":{\n    \"ATTRIBUTE[0]\":{\n        \"ORDER\":\n            \"ATTRIBUTE[0]:INPUT\":{\n                \"value_id\": 826\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen uploading the attribute with \"Input_type\": {\"MULTI_DROP_DOWN\"}, you can upload multiple \"value_id\" values, and \"value_id\" must \"value_id\" values must be some of the attribute list returned by the **/product/**get/**attribute/**result_order** API.\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```json\n\"attributes\":{\n    \"ATTRIBUTE[1]\":{\n        \"ATTRIBUTE[1]:ORDERS\":\n            \"ATTRIBUTE[1]:ORDER[0]\":{\n                \"value_id\": 826\n            },\n            \"ATTRIBUTE[1]:ORDER[1]\":{\n                \"value_id\": 827\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen uploading the attribute with \"Input_type\": {\"FREE_TEXT_FILL2\"}, you can only upload one \"value_A\" and specify A customization value. Therefore, you must omit the custom_value_A. If you provide it the custom value is the \"customiz_value_A\".\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```json\n\"attributes\":{\n    \"ATTRIBUTE[2]\":{\n        \"ATTRIBUTE[2]:ORDERS\":\n            \"ATTRIBUTE[2]:ORDER[0]\":{\n                \"value_id\": 0,\n                \"value_name\": \"92\",\n                \"customiz_value\": \"customiz1\"\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf the attribute has \"input_type\": {\"FREE_TEXT_FILL2\"} and requires a unit, you must upload a freestanding in the \"original_value_name\" field (Date 1, Date 1A, and if available, unit1=\"4\" parameter).\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```json\n\"attributes\":{\n    \"ATTRIBUTE[3]\":{\n        \"ATTRIBUTE[3]:ORDERS\":\n            \"ATTRIBUTE[3]:ORDER[0]\":{\n                \"value_id\": 0,\n                \"value_name\": \"92\",\n                \"customiz_value\": \"customiz2\"\n            },\n            \"value_id\": 826\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor the attribute with \"input_type\": {\"INPUT_COMBO_BOX\"}, you can only upload one \"value_id\" This \"value_id\" must be one of the values from the attribute list returned by the **/product/**get/**attribute/**result_order** API (please refer to Example 1 or upload one customization value in Example 3. If it is not a flagged, please refer to Example 4. For this case the value_id !=0 or exactly custom values.\n\nFor the attribute with \"input_type\": {\"MULTI_COMBO_BOX\"}, you can upload multiple \"value_id\" values from the attribute list returned by the **/product/**get/**attribute/**result_order** API, or exactly custom values.\n\n**Example 5**\n\n```json\n\"attributes\":{\n    \"ATTRIBUTE[4]\":{\n        \"ATTRIBUTE[4]:ORDERS\":\n            \"ATTRIBUTE[4]:ORDER[0]\":{\n                \"value_id\": 0,\n                \"value_name\": \"craft unit89\"\n            },\n            \"value_id\": 826\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Developer Guide - API Documentation\n\n## Example 1\n\n```ruby\napi/data.json: {\n  {\n    \"attribute_id\":\"AAAA\",\n    \"attribute_value\":{}\n  }\n  {\n    \"value_id\":120\n    \"original_value_name\":\"colorful_name\"\n  }\n  ,\n  ,\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nIf add a required, please refer to Example 4. If a hide type is required, please refer to Example 5.\n\n### Summary\n\nFor the attribute types, you must upload a \"value_id\". (For uploading a user-defined value, \"value_id\" must be 0 and the \"original_value_name\" is required).\n\nThe product API's default value, the \"original_value_name\" field must be uploaded in string format. If the API is not set to use special characters, you (then also upload the \"value_id\" if this required). If the example price field has two options, the first option must be for the \"attribute_value_id\", and the \"original_value_id\" is for the expansion of the **to_enabled_site_channel** API.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Uploading description\n\nWhen there are line breaks in the product description patterns to use extended_description, please refer to the **FAQ** for details on uploading.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Uploading price\n\nExcept for Saudi merchants which expect sellers to upload two decimal price original_price(s), for other marketplaces, sellers can use their own rules.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Uploading stock\n\nThe seller does not have a stock warehouse currently only used for available users then there is no need to update the stock.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Uploading shipment channels and shipping fee\n\nWhen uploading shipment channels, the seller must check which shipment channels will (several types, you can get the fee from **to_product_site_channel** API). fee types including:\n- RSE_SELECTION: The shipping is upload base on the weight-unit of the buyer can choose (sellers must use this for the product)\n- FLAT_FEE: Sellers upload the fixed base fee\n- FREE: Sellers pay the shipping fee (only as a seller promotion). In this seller, the fee and the (sellers) fee will not update the fee for the shipping fee, and all channel types support sufficient as shipping.\n\nThe seller can choose multiple channels for the product (selection/fee makes the product it open to this channel and the buyer can choose which buyers/channel choose to use in checkout) then the buyers. If the product is open, only then will it be shown as \"supported, the buyer does not test this tool for the shipping fee.\n\nFor the RSE_SELECTION channel, the size_ad must be calculated, and size_cd can be (required keys):\n- **to_enabled_site_channel API**\n\n### Example 1:\n\n```json\n\"height\":7\n\"shipment\":\"us\"\n\"width\":8\n\"original_value_name\"\n\"size\":\"Post Base\"\n\"type\":\"RSE_PICKUP\"\n```\n\n### Example 2:\n\nFor the RSE_DEPTH channel, the weight and dimension must be uploaded.\n\n```json\n\"height\":7\n\"package_weight\":71\n\"package_length\":20\n\"package_width\":19\n\"type\":\"us\"\n\"width\":7\n```\n\n### Example 3:\n\nFor the CUSTOM_PRICE channel, this shipping_fee must be uploaded.\n\n```json\n\"height\":7\n\"shipping_fee\":23.72\n\"width\":7\n\"size\":\"Post Base\"\n\"type\":\"CUSTOM_PRICE\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Creating Variants\n\nWhen you create (then size/available, **to_product_site_color**) will return the item_id, which is the unique identifier of the item.\n\nIf you also need to define specifications and create multiple option variants, such as the color and size, you can use **to_product_site_variant_specified** API for the next step, then we can create choice combinations, which will be the unique skus of variants.\n\n**Scenario 1:** The product has two specifications and the size contains A,S, and B. We can link it per variation groups.\n\n| bar_white | size | price | stock | SKU |\n|-----------|------|-------|-------|-----|\n| bar_white(1) | A/S | 100 | H | sku1 |\n| bar_white(2) | B | 200 | H | sku2 |\n| bar_white(3) | H | 300 | 12 | sku3 |\n\n**to_product_site_tier_variation** API request example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": 835558262,\n  \"tier_variation\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"size\",\n      \"option_list\": [\n        {\n          \"option\": \"65\",\n          \"image\": {\"value\":\"f3ec4c833f58ce950e9fea94b8e363e7\"}\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"size\",\n      \"option_list\": [\n        {\n          \"option\": \"8\",\n          \"image\": {\"value\":\"785ec833f58cce950e8fea93bbe364e7\"}\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"8\",\n      \"image\": {\"value\":\"785ec833f58cce950e8fea93bbe364e7\"}\n    }\n  ],\n  \"tier_index\": [0],\n  \"original_price\": 200,\n  \"price\": [1]\n  {\n    \"tier_index\": [0],\n    \"model_sku\": \"blue\",\n    \"original_price\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# API Documentation Extract\n\n## Scenario 2: Two-Product API\n\nThe product has color and size specifications; the color includes red and blue, and the size includes XL and L. We can this is two-variation product.\n\n### Product Table\n\n| var_index | color | size | price | stock | SKU |\n|-----------|-------|------|-------|-------|------|\n| var_skuindex[0] | Red | XL | 500 | 50 | sku1 |\n| var_skuindex[1] | Red | L | 300 | 20 | sku2 |\n| var_skuindex[2] | Blue | XL | 500 | 30 | sku3 |\n| var_skuindex[3] | Blue | L | 450 | 40 | sku4 |\n\n### v2.product.sku_list_update API Request Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"list_id\": \"10001+02\",\n  \"list_add_list\": [\n    {\n      \"user\": \"u1id\",\n      \"get_im_list\": [\n        {\n          \"image\": [\"image_id123c45def6a8bc7f8a9c0d37\"],\n          \"sel_var\": \"Red\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"image\": [\"image_id123c45def6a8bc7f8a9c0d37\"],\n          \"sel_var\": \"Blue\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"user\": \"s1_id\",\n      \"get_im_list\": [\n        {\n          \"sel_var\": \"XL\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"sel_var\": \"L\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scull\": [],\n  \"list_index\": [0, 0],\n  \"original_price\": 115,\n  \"model_stock\": 10,\n  \"seller_admin_sku\": \"sku1\"\n},\n{\n  \"list_index\": [0, 1],\n  \"original_price\": 200,\n  \"model_stock\": 20,\n  \"seller_admin_sku\": \"sku2\"\n},\n{\n  \"list_index\": [1, 0],\n  \"original_price\": 300,\n  \"model_stock\": 30,\n  \"seller_admin_sku\": \"sku3\"\n},\n{\n  \"list_index\": [1, 1],\n  \"original_price\": 400,\n  \"model_stock\": 40,\n  \"seller_admin_sku\": \"sku4\"\n}\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n**Please note that:**\n\n- The information of the SKU list will be displayed on the Shopee mall side in order. Shopper currently only supports the definition of two-variation products.\n- You can define an image for each variant. If it is a 2-tier variation product, you can only define the first item or variants. We suggest use product.UploadImg API to upload product image first; and then call product.add_Add or product.UpdateItem to get the image list of variants.\n- If there are two-variation products, there must be at least 1 item id under the firstvar_name.\n- The tier_index must start from 0 and not interface offered can and only will be supplied.\n- After uploading product images, you can use them in item_sku because this may be a legacy item.\n- After successful creation, you can call v2.product.get_model_list API to get the model id corresponding to each two_attrs.",
