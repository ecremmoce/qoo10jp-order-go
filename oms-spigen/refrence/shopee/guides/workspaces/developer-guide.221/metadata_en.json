Searching for item_id\nAPI: `v2.product.search_item`\n\nThis API allows you to search for a list of item_id based on some specific conditions, including\n- A list of item_id containing the product name keyword\n- A list of item_id containing the sku keyword\n- A list of item_id tracking inquiries attributes\n- A list of item_id tracking optional attributes\n\n---\n\n## 2. Getting product information\nAPI: `v2.product.get_item_base_info`, `v2.product.get_model_list`\n\nYou can call `v2.product.get_item_base_info` to get the product base information, otherwise you also need to call `v2.product.get_model_list` API to get the variants price and stock\n\nThe field \"has_model\" in `v2.product.get_item_base_info` API indicates whether the product has variants or not.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Getting the data of product\nAPI: `v2.product.get_item_extra_info`\n\nThis API can get the data of views, likes, sales, ratings, and star rating from a product.\n\nThe date of views is from the last 90 days' statistics, the sales data is the cumulative value.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Getting product promotion information\nAPI: `v2.product.get_item_promotion`\n\nThis API allows you to get information about all ongoing or upcoming promotions that the product is added in. If the product is added into multiple promotions, the promotion_id field of `v2.product.get_item_promotion` will return more than one promotion_id, and we suggest you to continue to call `v2.product.get_item_promotion` to get all the permissions information.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Updating product information\nAPI: `v2.product.update_item`\n\n1. This API supports updating product information except for the size_chart/price/stock/video information. Fields that are updateable will be updated, and fields that are not updateable will not be updated.\n\n2. For item_sku/wholesales/video_upload_id, we support the delete operation. If you upload the null string then we will delete it.\n\nExample of deleting item_sku\n```\n\"item_sku\":6001B2459,\n\"item_sku\":\"\"\n```\n\n3. Please refer to the FAQ about updating related descriptions.\n\n4. If you do not update some fields but encountered a prompt that those fields are filled in incorrectly, this situation is normal because every time you update, we will verify the legitimacy of all the product information, so if it does not meet the requirements, please modify it.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Unlisting or deleting product\nAPI: `v2.product.unlist_item`, `v2.product.delete_item`\n\n\"unlist\" - true means the product will be unlist,\"unlist\" - false, means the product will be re-listed\n\nThis API can change item_status to be \"deleted\", please note that after the deletion, you will not be able to update the product and the seller can not view this item through the Seller Center.\n\nFor Shopee deleted and Seller deleted products, within 90 days, you can still get the product information through API, after 90 days, the product data will be permanently deleted in Shopee database, you can not query any information about this product. If you need, please save the product information in time.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Updating size chart image\nAPI: `v2.product.update_size_chart`\n\nThis API can be used to add or update the image size chart of the product. If you encounter the error \"Your shop can not edit image size chart\", please check the announcement.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Registering Brand\nAPI: `v2.product.register_brand`\n\nSellers can register their own brands through this API. If Shopee audits this brand successfully, you will get a valid brand_id for adding or updating products.\n\nYou can check the brand registration status check the FAQ\n\n*The following content is only applicable to CN/SG/PH/SG sellers.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Getting global product list\nAPI: `v2.global_product.get_global_item_list`\n\nThis API allows you to get a list of all global_item_id or filter by update_time range under the merchant. This API will not return a list of deleted global_item_id\n\n---\n\n## 10. Getting a global product ID\nAPI: `v2.global_product.get_global_item_id`\n\nBy calling this API, you can quickly find the global_item_id of a shop product\n\n---\n\n## 11. Getting global product information\nAPI: `v2.global_product.get_global_item_info`, `v2.global_product.get_global_model_list`\n\n1. If the global product does not contain variants, you only need to call `v2.global_product.get_global_item_info` to get the global product information, otherwise you also need to call `v2.global_product.get_global_model_list` to get the variants stock and price information\n\n2. global_product-related interfaces are not served on global products\n\nYou can call `v2.product.get_item_extra_info` to get the shop product data or call `v2.product.get_item_promotion` to get the promotion data of shop products.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Updating global products\nAPI: `v2.global_product.update_global_item`\n\n1. Since some fields can be managed by global products and shop products together, you can check the article \"Updateable or not-updateable fields\" to view the fields synchronized by the global product level to the shop product level. The API will be listed, synchronized through v2_global_item APIs, both API, then Shopee will automatically synchronize to shop products after you update the global product\n\n---\n\n## 13. Deleting global product\nAPI: `v2.global_product.delete_global_item`\n\nGlobal products do not support \"unlist\", but can be deleted. After the global products are deleted, all published shop products will also be deleted\n\n---\n\n## 14. Updating the size chart image\nAPI: `v2.global_product.update_size_chart`\n\nThis API allows you to add or update the size chart of global products. If you want to update the size chart of a shop product through a global product, you can call the `v2.product.update_size_chart` API.\n\nYou can check this FAQ to learn more about which product module interface permissions CN/SG/PH/SG sellers have individually.",
