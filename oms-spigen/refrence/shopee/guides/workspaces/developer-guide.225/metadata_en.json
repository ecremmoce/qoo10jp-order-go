Because the API has authentication, when calling the v2.first_mile.bind_first_mile_tracking_number API, only one shop's order can be called for one call, so please make sure the order_sn and shop_id match for each time you call\n\n**Q: Will the order status change after successful binding?**\nA: Yes, after binding FM successfully and being scanned, the order status of all orders being bound will be updated from PROCESSED to SHIPPED.\n\n**Q: Should I ship the order and print the airway bill first or first mile bind first?**\nA: The correct order is to ship the order first, then print the airway bill, then bind the first mile tracking number for order.\n\n**Q: How can I check the first mile tracking number of an order?**\nA: You can use v2.logistics.get_tracking_number API and upload the request parameter response_optional_fields: first_mile_tracking_number then you can get the first-mile tracking number of an order\n\n**Q: What can first_mile_tracking_number status be bound?**\nA: You can query the first-mile tracking number status through v2.first_mile.get_detail API.\n\n1. If ship_method is a pickup:\n   - If the first_mile_tracking_number is just generated, the status is NOT_AVAILABLE, at that time, the order can be bound.\n   - If the first_mile_tracking_number tracking status is ORDER_RECEIVED, it means that there are orders that have already been bound, and you can continue to bind other orders.\n   - If the first_mile_tracking_number status is PICKED_UP, indicating that the parcels have been collected by the channel, and can no longer bind the order.\n   - If the first_mile_tracking_number status is DELIVERED, which means that the parcel has arrived at the warehouse, and orders can no longer be bound.\n\n2. If ship_method is drop off or self-deliver: there is no status restriction.\n\n**Q: Does self-deliver still need to call the API for first mile binding?**\nA: Yes, even self-delivery is the offline ship action for sellers, but you still need to call v2.first_mile.bind_first_mile_tracking_number API for the first-mile binding.\n\n**Q: What status can I unbind the first mile tracking number for an order?**\nA: 1. If ship_method is a pick up, only if the first_mile_tracking_number status is ORDER_RECEIVED can be unbird\n   2. If ship_method is drop off or self-deliver, there is no first_mile_tracking_number status restriction.\n\n## Data definition\n\n**First Mile tracking number status**\n- ORDER_RECEIVED\n- PICKED_UP\n- DELIVERED",
