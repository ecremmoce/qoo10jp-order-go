Processing of Personal Data\n\n14.1 You shall Process Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws, and at all times maintain, and ensure compliance with, privacy policies which meet the minimum standards under the applicable laws.\n\n14.2 Prior to sharing any Personal Data with Shopee, you shall ensure that Data Subjects are appropriately notified of and have consented to Shopee's privacy practices. You warrant that you have a legitimate basis and adequate title to collect and share Personal Data with Shopee.\n\n14.3 The following provisions shall apply to the Processing of Personal Data which was obtained or derived from any Shopee Content:\n\n- (a) In relation to such Personal Data, as between you and Shopee, you are a data intermediary and shall Process the Personal Data on behalf of Shopee in accordance with this DPP.\n\n- (b) You shall Process Personal Data only to the extent, and in such manner, as is required to develop, operate and maintain your Applications in accordance with the Terms of Service and Shopee's written instructions.\n\n- (c) You are authorised to use Sub-processors, provided that you (i) enter into an agreement with the Sub-processor imposing data protection obligations on the Sub-processor that are at least as restrictive as the obligations under this DPP, (ii) undertake to provide a copy of the aforesaid agreement to Shopee promptly upon request, and (iii) shall remain liable for any act or omission of any Sub-processor that does not comply with the requirements of this DPP.\n\n- (d) You shall not cause or permit any Personal Data to be transferred across borders in breach of applicable laws. Cross-border transfers of Personal Data subject to legal restrictions by applicable laws shall require Shopee's prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, this transfer restriction does not pertain to Shopee personnel access to Personal Data.\n\n- (e) To the extent legally permitted, you shall immediately notify Shopee in writing upon receipt of an order, demand, or document purporting to request, demand or compel the production of Personal Data to any third party. You shall not disclose Personal Data to the third party without providing Shopee at least forty-eight (48) hours' notice, so that Shopee may, at its own expense, exercise such rights as it may have under applicable laws to prevent or limit such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and limit any such disclosure and to otherwise preserve the confidentiality of Personal Data; additionally, you will cooperate with Shopee with respect to any action taken pursuant to such order, demand, or other document request, including to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to Personal Data.\n\n- (f) You agree that Shopee may for any reason, in its sole discretion and with or without notice or liability to you, immediately suspend or terminate your Account or access to the Platform and Services, remove or discard from the Site any Content associated with your Account, and/or take any other actions that Shopee deems necessary to protect itself and any Protected Data. Grounds for such actions may include, but are not limited to, actual or suspected (a) extended periods of inactivity, (b) violation of the letter or spirit of this DPP, (c) security failures by you, including failure to cooperate in any security audit or to take reasonable remediation steps required by Shopee, (d) any data leakage or loss attributable to you or your clients, or (e) any other behaviour that is harmful to Shopee's Users, third parties, or the business interests of Shopee. Use of an Account for illegal, fraudulent, harassing, defamatory, threatening or abusive purposes may be referred to law enforcement authorities without notice to you. Without limitation to any other remedy available, if a legal dispute arises or law enforcement action or other regulatory inquiry is commenced relating to your Account or your use of the Services for any reason, Shopee may terminate your Account immediately with or without notice.\n\n- (g) Without limitation to any other remedy or indemnity available under the Terms of Service, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Shopee, and its shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all loss, claims, actions, proceedings, and suits and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, any other dispute resolution expenses) incurred by Shopee or any Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to, without limitation, (a) your violation or breach of any term of this DPP or any policy or guidelines referenced herein, (b) your use or misuse of the Platform, any Shopee Content, Restricted Data, Protected Data and/or Personal Data, and (c) your breach of any law or any rights of a third party, including any applicable data protection laws.\n\n# 15. Effective Period\n\nYour obligations and Shopee's rights under this DPP shall become effective from the date you access the Platform, and will continue in effect until the termination of the Terms of Service and for any period thereafter during which you and your personnel have possession of or access to any Protected Data.",
