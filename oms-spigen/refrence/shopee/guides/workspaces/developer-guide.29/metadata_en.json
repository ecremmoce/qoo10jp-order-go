Summary\n\n1) When you create an app, or use an existing app, please make sure that your app type can call the v2.0 GlobalProduct API\n\n2) The shop needs the seller's authorization to provide the seller's information\n\n3) The necessary condition for calling the APP status is that the seller users can use the KBSC/PI in the production environment. The shops are allowed to have KBSC/PI seller account information. APP will automatically be approved after 24 hours.\n\n4) The seller needs to log into KBSC and complete the relevant settings before the KBSC product upgrade is successful. Only when the product is successfully upgraded, can the Global Product API be called normally.\n\n5) You can learn more GBSC API FAQ from here: [GBSC API FAQ](#)\n\n---\n\nIf you have any technical connection problems that are not covered by this document, please contact Shopee Open Platform through the [ticket system](#).",
