  "extracted_text": "# Product Catalog API - Developer Guide\n\n## API Root Resource > Product citation properties\n\nNote: product.fetch takes a required attribute. But it can be in flexible category data or `us.product.req_category` API. Each match's category for a unique category_id.\n\n## 1.1 Global category data\n\nShopee's category tree data applies to all markets, but according to the local policies of the market, some of the categories are not in enabled properties. That is, when you use this API to get a list of categories, the API will return the full list, but a list of all categories. But in fact in a Marketplace shop, you can get more than what you see here is the full list. But in fact in a Marketplace shop, you can use only a small part of the categories. In short, global data means all the list of categories, and according to the category data with this only. For different types of batches, there are also some differences in the supported category data.\n\nSo, in order for you to get the most accurate category data, it is recommended to select a shop to query shop_id.\n\n## 1.2 Category tree\n\nThe category tree has three levels and available categories for the shop.\n\nWhen you call the global category API, the tree that is returned is the complete Shopee category tree containing all categories, but the shop for a category in a particular market may not support adding products directly under this category. That is, children-filled means that the last level category, otherwise, it means that the category has children. Please note that only categories under Level 1 category or Level 2 category can be used to create or upload products.\n\nFor example: If the category tree path is Level 1 category -> Level 2 category -> Level 3 category, then API return like the category data shown below.\n\n```\n\"display_category_name\": \"Level 1 category\",\n\"has_children\": true,\n```\n\nLevel 1 category:\n\n```\n\"original_category_name\": \"Level 1 category\",\n\"display_category_id\": 100001\n```\n\nLevel 2 category:\n\n```\n\"display_category_name\": \"Level 2 category\",\n\"has_children\": true,\n```\n\nLevel 2 category:\n\n```\n\"original_category_name\": \"Level 2 category\",\n\"display_category_id\": 100002\n```\n\nLevel 3 category:\n\n```\n\"display_category_name\": \"Level 3 category\",\n\"has_children\": false,\n```\n\nLevel 3 category:\n\n```\n\"original_category_name\": \"Level 3 category\",\n\"display_category_id\": 100003\n```\n\n## 1.3 Recommend categories\n\nAfter you have uploaded your products using the attributes of the product, you can also call `v2.product.category_recommend API`. API will return a list of recommended categories based on the product name and product image.\n\n## 2. Attribute\n\nEach category may have different attribute lists. The `v2.product.get_attribute_tree` API will return the attribute data for the input category. But the API will not return a list of categories, so you will need to call the category API to get which categories can receive attribute data. A user must ensure that product attributes and attribute values are defined as rule series the value of the \"has_custom\" field under the \"category_id\" section ensures that certain attributes can be customized.\n\n## 2.1 Required and optional Attributes\n\nFor some attributes within products, an attribute must be uploaded, while optional attributes can be provided.\n\nSellers can add optional product attributes to the product. For example, `is_mandatory` in the return result must be uploaded, while optional attributes such as warranty-related attributes can be uploaded based on seller decision.\n\nThat is, \"is_mandatory\": optional attributes are optional attributes.\n\n## 2.2 Type of attributes\n\nWe classify attributes types based on factors such as whether the attribute can supports multiple selections, whether it allows custom values, etc.\n\n| # | Type | Definition | Description | Custom value is required | Attribute values can be input |\n|---|------|------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1 | int | SINGLE_DROP_DOWN | Single-select dropdown. Sellers can only choose one value from the list of allowed values returned by `attribute_value_list` returned by the API to upload. | No | Yes |\n| 2 | int | SINGLE_COMBO_BOX | Single-select dropdown + text input field. Sellers can select a value from the list of allowed attribute values, or freely enter an attribute value. `attribute_value_list` returned by the API can get the list of custom value. | Yes | Yes |\n| 3 | int | FREE_TEXT_FIELD | Free text field - can set a custom value. | Yes | No |\n| 4 | int | MULTI_DROP_DOWN | Multi-select dropdown. Sellers can select multiple options from the list of attribute values returned by `attribute_value_list` returned by the API to upload, or set a custom value. | No | Yes |\n| 5 | int | MULTI_COMBO_BOX | Multi-select dropdown + text input field. Sellers can select multiple options from the list of attribute values or freely enter attribute values returned by `attribute_value_list` returned by the API to upload, or set a custom value. | Yes | Yes |\n\n*The following figure shows an example with `input_type` is SINGLE_COMBO_BOX. Sellers can select a value from the attribute list (Upright Trainers), or set a custom value by changing the \"Add a new button\" item (Long A).\n\n**Example UI:**\n- Fitness Machine Type [Please select dropdown]\n  - [Cancel] [OK] buttons\n  - Elliptical Trainers ← Arrow pointing to\n  - **+ Add a new item**\n- Fitness Machine Type [Please select dropdown]\n  - [Cancel] [OK] buttons\n  - Elliptical Trainers\n  - **+ Add**\n\n**Please note:**\n- For products with attributes that support multi-select dropdown, you can get the maximum number of attribute values that can be uploaded through the \"max_value_count\" parameter.\n- You can use the attribute values provided by Shopee in the attribute values list, or add through the \"attribute_value\" API parameter if it's available.\n\n## 2.3 Data types of attribute values\n\nAttribute values have different data types. For example: You can upload the attribute values according to the required data type. You can obtain the data type of the attribute value through the `input_validation_type` field returned by the `v2.product.get_attribute_tree` API.\n\n| # | input_validation_type | Type | Description | Samples |\n|---|-----------------------|------|-------------|---------|\n| 0 | int | VALIDATE_NO_VALIDATE_TYPE | | |\n| 1 | int | VALIDATE_INT_TYPE | | |\n| 2 | int | VALIDATE_STRING_TYPE | | |\n| 3 | int | VALIDATE_FLOAT_TYPE | | |\n| 4 | int | VALIDATE_DATE_TYPE, including two formats: | While editing or editing a product, for example, use the Manufacture Date below: Format1: YYYY-MM-DD, such as: 31082021 Format2: YYYY.Y, e.g.,2021.3 | When the format you entered is a number + unit format. Displays units (attribute_unit) for corresponding attributes which you can view in the attribute values list attribute provided by the API. For example, if the attribute value is in available, then: |\n\n**Please note:**\n- For the data type attribute, there are two formats: one is MONTH.DAY (2021.2) and the other is DATE (YYYY-MM-DD). These formats are provided by the `format_type` API returned by the `v2.product.get_attribute_tree` API.\n- For the data type attribute, the number unit format must be a value. For product attributes like \"original_value_name\" field, however, when critiquing product information, the \"original_value_name\" field is the input's \"attribute_value\" field.\n\n---\n\n# Developer Guide - Product Attributes\n\n## 2.4 Attribute value units\n\nWhen the returned attribute type is \"quantitative\", it means the attribute values with options to choose units such as \"cm\" and \"oz\". Therefore, you need to first understand which attribute values require a unit and which units are available for those attribute values. You can call the `c_product_get_attribute_unit` API to obtain this information.\n\n### Quantitative Unit Information\n\nWhen the returned parameter \"format_type\" is \"FORMAT_QUANTITATIVE_WITH_UNIT\" is present, it means the attribute value requires a unit, such as \"attribute_unit\" for attribute value. Under the \"attribute_unit\" object, \"unit_list\" contains all units available for this attribute, and the \"default_unit\" shows which unit is displayed by default.\n\nFor the attribute value list provided by Shopee, we'll display the value and the unit separately. Specifically, the \"name\" field is the attribute value, the \"unit\" part is for display purposes only, and the \"default_attribute_value_unit\" is the unit that is actually submitted in the format shown, e.g., \"kg\" for kilograms.\n\n---\n\n## 2.5 Parent attribute and parent brand\n\nFor example, to the \"weight Type\" attribute, the associated attribute values are \"body-Weight\" and \"capacity\". The \"body-Weight\" attribute is the \"Weight Type\" parent attribute value. Therefore, where the seller selects \"body-Weight\" for the \"Weight Type\" attribute, the \"Body-Weight-Type\" attribute will be displayed, and we recommend that the seller fill in the \"Selecting-Barefoot\" variant value and show the Body-Weight-Type attribute.\n\n| Weight Type | Body Weight | Weight Size | Tolerance (kg) | etc |\n|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----|\n| Body Weight | Barefoot | | | |\n\n\"Selecting 'Body Weight'\" value displays the Body Weight Type Attribute\n\n| Weight Type | Body Barefoot | Weight Size | Tolerance (kg) | etc |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-----|\n| Body Barefoot Type | | | | |\n\n---\n\n## Example API Response\n\n```json\n\"v2.product.get_attribute_time\" API portal response\n\n{\n  \"attribute_id\": 100001,\n  \"mandatory\": false,\n  \"name\": \"Weight Type\",\n  \"attribute_value_list\": [\n    {\n      \"value_id\": 0,\n      \"name\": \"Barefoot\",\n      \"unit\": \"text\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"language\": \"en-text\",\n      \"value\": \"BBB\"\n    }\n  ],\n  {\n    \"value_id\": 200,\n    \"name\": \"Body-Weight\",\n    \"attribute_unit\": {\n      \"attribute_id\": 100002,\n      \"mandatory\": false,\n      \"name\": \"Body Weight Type\",\n      \"attribute_value_list\": [\n        {\n          \"value_id\": 10,\n          \"level_type\": [\n            {\n              \"language\": \"en-text\",\n              \"value\": \"BBB\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"attribute_unit\": {\n        \"need_input\": true,\n        \"input_validation_type\": 2,\n        \"format_type\": \"FORMAT_QUANTITATIVE_WITH_UNIT\",\n        \"support_search_in_value\": false\n      }\n    },\n    \"level_text\": {\n      \"language\": \"en-text\",\n      \"value\": \"請輸入數值BBB\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BJJ-text\": {\n    \"language\": \"en-text\",\n    \"value\": \"請輸入數值\"\n  }\n}\n]\n},\n{\n  \"attribute_unit\": {\n    \"need_input\": true,\n    \"input_validation_type\": 2,\n    \"format_type\": \"\",\n    \"unit_list\": [],\n    \"support_search_in_value\": false\n  },\n  \"level_text\": {\n    \"language\": \"en-text\",\n    \"value\": \"輸入數值資訊\"\n  }\n}\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, \"Weight Type\" is the parent attribute, and \"Body Weight Type\" is the child attribute. To upload the child attribute, you must also submit the associated parent attribute.\n\n---\n\n## 2.6 Recommended attributes\n\nTo help sellers quickly find the recommended attributes for the product, you can call `c_product_list_recommend_attribute` API to retrieve them. There are only recommended attributes for a minority of categories. Typically, the API only lists categories that have recommend attributes.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Brand\n\nYou can upload the brand information for the product, but we not require certain categories to do so, since brand information are also categorized under certain categories. Some categories require brand selection. To check whether or not a category requires brand information, make a call to `c_product_get_category` API (see the category structure). \n\nA \"mandatory\" field that means that the category must be filled with brand information.\n\nIf the brand that the seller wishes to upload is not listed in the dropdown list, you can submit a registered brand application to Shopee, please call `c_product_register_brand` API and refer to this `App` for QC process.\n\n> **Note:** Sellers cannot submit brand applications for any categories. Excluding for brand-centric brands, e.g., a brand can choose the brand value.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Days to ship\n\nAfter the buyer makes the purchase, the seller must deliver a 1-5 category sales limit required to fulfill orders within that time period. Different categories and different sales types, sellers need to fulfill orders within the \"days to ship\" you specify, up to a max of 7 days (excluding pre-order items). The buyer will see how long it will take the seller to fulfill the order from the product page. You can get the shipping days information through the `c_product_list_dts_limit` API.\n\nIf you do, or for the category, specify a \"dts_limit\", it means that the category does not support pre-sales. If the \"dts\" field is 1, the seller can select a \"days_to_ship\" of 7 days or less.\n\n> **Please note that we are rolling out the low chain of table type**, and thus only some whitelisted sellers can put through the \"days_to_ship\" parameter. For more detailed information, please refer to: https://open.shopee.com/documents/v2/v2.product.add_item?module=89&type=1\n\n---\n\n## 6. Product restrictions\n\nWe have certain restrictions on product information, such as the length of characters that can be filled in or image size limits. These restrictions are unified across Shopee's platforms. For details, please refer to the product_tag_list API `shopee.com/1.0.0/product/get_item_limit` to obtain information.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Size chart\n\nFor some categories, we support sellers uploading one size chart image for a product, you can use v2.product.support_size_chart API to check whether the category (leaf category) supports size chart.\n\n*Please note that we are rolling out the size chart of table type, and now only some whitelisted sellers can add through the seller center, open api does not support returning the categories that support the table size chart and uploading. So whitelisted sellers please ignore the results from the v2.product.support_size_chart API.\n\n# 6. Product restrictions\n\nWe have certain restrictions on product information, such as the length of characters that can be filled in the product name, the range of product price, etc. We have different restrictions for different markets and different types of sellers. You can get the limits we set through v2.product.get_item_limit API.\n\n# 7. Product logistics\n\nYou can get the logistics_channel_id through v2.logistics.get_channel_list API, you can only choose the channel with enabled=true and mask_channel_id=0 for product.",
