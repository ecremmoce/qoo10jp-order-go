Package Fulfillment Status\n\n### Package Status Flow\n\n**Two parallel flows:**\n\n**Left side (Standard flow):**\n```\nPLACED\n↓\nREADY_TO_SHIP\n↓\nSHIPPED\n↓\nIN_TRANSIT\n↓\nDELIVERED\n↓\nCOMPLETED\n```\n\n**Right side (Alternative states):**\n```\nREADY_TO_SHIP\n↓\nPICKUP_REQUESTED\n↓\nPICKUP_FAILED\n↓\nRETURNED\n↓\nRETURN_IN_TRANSIT\n↓\nRETURN_DELIVERED\n```\n\n### Package Status Descriptions\n\n**Status definitions:**\n\n- **PLACED:** Package created but not yet ready\n- **READY_TO_SHIP:** Package is prepared and ready for carrier pickup\n- **PICKUP_REQUESTED:** Carrier pickup has been scheduled\n- **SHIPPED:** Package picked up by carrier\n- **IN_TRANSIT:** Package is being transported\n- **DELIVERED:** Package delivered successfully\n- **PICKUP_FAILED:** Carrier failed to pick up package\n- **RETURNED:** Package is being returned\n- **RETURN_IN_TRANSIT:** Return package in transit\n- **RETURN_DELIVERED:** Return package delivered back to seller\n- **COMPLETED:** Package fulfillment complete\n\n---\n\n## 4. Getting order list and details\n\n**Endpoints:**\n\n- `GET /api/v1/orders` - Get the list of orders with different order status\n- `GET /api/v1/orders/{order_id}` - View order details\n\n---\n\n## 5. Canceling Order\n\n**Endpoint:**\n\n- `POST /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/cancel` - Use this to cancel orders\n\n**Note:** Need to handle Exceptions and cancellation requests.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Splitting Order\n\n### 6.1 Splitting\n\n**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/orders/split`\n\nWhen an order contains multiple items, the split order function can help you arrange shipping for each item separately according to its readiness to be delivered.\n\n**API Request example:**\n\nIn this request, the order contains 4 items and is divided into two packages.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"order_id\": \"ORDER123\",\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"package_id\": \"PKG001\",\n      \"item_list\": [\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM001\",\n          \"quantity\": 2\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"package_id\": \"PKG002\", \n      \"item_list\": [\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM002\",\n          \"quantity\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM003\",\n          \"quantity\": 1\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Split Examples\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"ITEM004\",\n  \"quantity\": 3,\n  \"order_item_id\": \"ORDERITEM001\",\n  \"product_id\": \"PROD001\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"ITEM005\",\n  \"quantity\": 2,\n  \"order_item_id\": \"ORDERITEM002\",\n  \"product_id\": \"PROD002\",\n  \"variant_list\": []\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"ITEM006\",\n  \"quantity\": 1,\n  \"order_item_id\": \"ORDERITEM003\",\n  \"product_id\": \"PROD003\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"ITEM007\",\n  \"quantity\": 4,\n  \"order_item_id\": \"ORDERITEM004\",\n  \"product_id\": \"PROD004\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"ITEM008\",\n  \"quantity\": 1,\n  \"order_item_id\": \"ORDERITEM005\",\n  \"product_id\": \"PROD005\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item_id\": \"ITEM009\",\n  \"quantity\": 2,\n  \"order_item_id\": \"ORDERITEM006\",\n  \"product_id\": \"PROD006\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**BACK** (button at bottom right)\n\n---\n\n# Shipment API Developer Guide\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n```python\n\"rate_id\": \"123456789\"\n```\n\n```python\n\"order_id\": \"123456789\"\n```\n\n```python\n\"order_id_value\": \"123456789\"\n```\n\n```python\n\"parcel_id_group_id\": []\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tips\n\n1. Split order permission by the shop front. If you get the error \"You don't have the permission to split order\" when splitting orders, you should go to Seller Center to grant the split order permission.\n\n2. Items under the same bundle deal and are on deal promotion cannot be split into different packages. Only for multiple item promotions, sellers have to contact operation team every time to ask for split policy for risk control.\n\n3. After splitting an order with multi-address, we expect to receive split order requests with the same split policy same bundle deal and the add_on_deal_id is the same, indicating that they are in the same add-on deal. Packages may come from one item of the same deal id group serial id, you can not split them into different package request when calling this split api.\n\n4. When you upload a new package and the package list contains items that are ready to ship, and some items are not ready to ship instance, if 3 order items in a (total) deal and a configure a deal, the order can be split into two packages. You can only split through this api when the same deal items are in the same package and you only split deal items. The package with ready to ship item(s) will change to READY_TO_SHIP status and others will be UNPAID or INIT status. However, items in the package with Initialized status are still considered as the items at the order.\n\n5. Once an \"Spiltted\"\n\n6. [Additional note] The order status is READY_TO_SHIP before the order can be canceled splitting. If any parcel has been INIT/UNPAID, sellers must arrange shipment.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Getting package list and details for shipment\n\nUse [sv_order_package_list](link) and [Shipment API](link) to fetch the order and its package shipped, with various filters as per your need. The api is preferred to fetch packages for shipment.\n\n**View more at** [sv_order_package_list](link) **for more info.**\n\n---\n\n## 8. Shipment API Call Flow\n\n[THIS IS FIGURE/CHART: A detailed flowchart showing the Shipment API call flow with multiple decision points and process steps. The flowchart includes various yellow boxes representing different stages of the shipment process, with connecting lines and decision diamonds.]\n\n---\n\n## 8.1 Basic Shipping Logic\n\n1. Get the list of packages to be shipped via `package_status of 1 (SHIPPED)` through [sv_logistics_package_list API](link)\n\n   **Note:** `order_sn` & `package_number` are used to identify a package.\n\n2. Logistics charges are determined, seller should also see of package/prom_integrated shipping method to ship. Call [sv_logistics_init_info API](link) and [sv_logistics_shipping_parameter API](link) to get the shipping document. After init, parameter by [sv_logistics_channel](link), the package lists the pickup address and estimated shipping cost. The caller can get the tracking number, if the logistics provider has generated that. Then the API will return the tracking number and upload it to the request body. After the API call is successful, the package fulfillment status of pickup / request status will be updated. Alternatively [sv_logistics_ship API](link) or [sv_logistics_confirm_order_status API](link) and upload the required info automatically generated by logistics provider or self-defined by sellers.\n\n3. After successful shipment using the Shopee integration channel, you can call [sv_logistics_get_tracking_number API](link) to get the Shopee generated tracking number. Alternatively you can call [sv_logistics_get_tracking_info API](link) to fetch the full tracking information.\n\n4. After getting the tracking number, you can print the group list \"You can choose two ways, self-print or Shopee generated.\" With Shopee print-ready API use [sv_logistics_create_shipping_document API](link), you will have a tracking label, shipping document, and shipping order form to [LOGISTICS_PICKUP_DONE](status)\n\n5. To get the Shopee airway bill PDF of the shipped package, you can call on how busy APIs are by time [sv_logistics_get_airway_bill API](link). You can also use [sv_logistics_download_shipping_document API](link), [sv_logistics_download_shipping_document_result](link).\n\n6. When calling the [sv_logistics_get_shipping_parameter API](link) to get the shipping parameters, the slug parameter is returned based on the package. The returned values calling the [sv_logistics_shipping_document API](link) is for this package via API. Let the business fill the LOGISTICS (3rd), there is no need to print pickup list. 3PL will provide the airway list and complete the shipping process. Seller in [logistics_channel_id](param), specify slug=dropoff so that only the \"slug=dropoff\" The package will be ready to self-print out.\n\n---\n\n## 8.2 Related APIs for order shipment\n\n| API | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| [sv_order_search_package_list](link) | Get a list of packages which not shipped yet |\n| [sv_order_get_package_detail](link) | Get package details |\n| [sv_logistics_get_shipping_parameter](link) | Get shipping parameters |\n| [sv_logistics_get_order_list](link) | Get order list |\n| [sv_logistics_ship_order](link) | Arrange shipment |\n| [sv_logistics_get_address_list_parcel](link) | - |\n| [sv_logistics_get_tracking_number](link) | Get tracking number |\n| [sv_logistics_get_order_tracking_number](link) | - |\n| [sv_logistics_get_shipping_document_data_info](link) | Get the information you need to self-print your bill |\n| [sv_logistics_get_shipping_document_parameter](link) | Access to transaction and recommended bill template |\n| [sv_logistics_create_shipping_document](link) | Create airway bill task |\n| [sv_logistics_get_shipping_document_result](link) | Get airway bill task result |\n| [sv_logistics_download_shipping_document](link) | Download Shopee generated airway bill |\n\n---\n\n## 8.3 API request example\n\n### 8.3.1 [sv_logistics_get_shipping_parameter](link)\n\nRequest example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"v\": \"\",\n  \"message\": \"\",\n  \"request\": {\n    \"info_needed\": {\n      \"dropoff\": [],\n      \"pickup\": [],\n      \"order\": []\n    },\n    \"order_sn\": \"\",\n    \"dropoff\": \"\",\n    \"count\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n*Note: This extraction maintains the original English text structure from the developer guide screenshot, preserving headings, code blocks, tables, and formatting as requested.*\n\n---\n\n# Developer Guide - API Documentation\n\n## Setup\n\n```javascript\n\"shipping\": {\n  \"track_id\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Order Structure\n\n```javascript\n\"stage\": {\n  \"address_id\": \"5206\",\n  \"region\": \"KR\",\n  \"state\": \"Seoul/Busan\",\n  \"city\": \"Incheon/Busan\",\n  \"district\": \"\",\n  \"addr\": \"\",\n  \"address\": \"22319\",\n  \"zipcode\": \"03037\",\n  \"address_line\": {\n    \"default_address\",\n    \"invoice_address\",\n    \"refund_address\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Item List Structure\n\n```javascript\n\"line_item_list\": [\n  {\n    \"sku\": \"10WSTCROS\",\n    \"original_id\": \"10WSTCROS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sku\": \"10W0000WL\",\n    \"original_id\": \"10W0000WL\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Address Information\n\n```javascript\n\"address_id\": \"5206\",\n\"region\": \"KR\",\n\"state\": \"Seoul/Busan\",\n\"city\": \"Incheon/Busan\",\n\"district\": \"\",\n\"addr\": \"\",\n\"address\": \"huga CSR\",\n\"zipcode\": \"03122\",\n\"address_line\": []\n```\n\n## Transaction List\n\n```javascript\n\"line_item_list\": [\n  {\n    \"sku\": \"10WSTCROS\",\n    \"original_id\": \"10WSTCROS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sku\": \"10W0000WL\",\n    \"original_id\": \"10W0000WL\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Payment Configuration\n\n```javascript\n\"payment_id\": \"GARMIN0913FUT-hp2t8n353e6f1807\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Note: The ark_needed field indicates the shipping method supported by the order\n\n**Note:** The ark_needed field indicates the shipping method supported by the order and the parameters this need to be passed.
