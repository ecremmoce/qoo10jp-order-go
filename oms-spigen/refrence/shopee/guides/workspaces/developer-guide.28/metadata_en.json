Sub-accounts cannot finish the authorization. The account format of the main account is: **\" main\n\nAfter the account is successfully logged in, you will see the Authorization page, first check the shop you want to authorize and then click Auth Merchant. If you do not check Auth Merchant, you will not be able to call the relevant Global Product API or to obtain the Merchant information. If some shops are not checked, the product cannot be published to the related shop through the API.

But then you call the RefreshAccessToken API to obtain different refresh token for different shop ids, will return different refresh tokens and access token, so please keep their tokens separately.\n\nIf you want to obtain the relationship between the merchant id and the shop id, please call the [get_shop_list_by_merchant](link).\nThen you can get each merchant information by calling the seller API: [get_merchant_info](link) and call [get_shop_info](link) to get each shop information.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Summary\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1) When you create an app, or use an existing app, please make sure that your app type can call the V.2 GlobalProduct API. (type: public_app/private_shop_app)\n\n2) The shop needs to be upgraded to CNSC before you call GlobalProduct API\n\n3) It is necessary to ensure that the APP status is **Online**, so that seller users can use the CNSC API in the production environment. Clicking Live the App, Open Platform will start to receive product information. APP will automatically be approved after 24 hours.\n\n4) The seller needs to log in to CNSC and complete the relevant settings before the CNSC product upgrade is successful.\n\n5) Only when the product is successfully upgraded, can the Global Product API be called normally.\n\n6) Please refresh your token after authorization is finished (based on [document](link))\n\n---\n\n### Support\n\nIf you have any technical connection problems that are not covered by this document, please contact Shopee Open Platform through the [ticket system](link).",
